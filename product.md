# LagSource

## Tagline
Instantly identify what’s causing lag — without profiling or guesswork.

## Overview
LagSource is a lightweight, read-only diagnostics plugin that tells server administrators what entity types and chunks are causing lag **right now**.

When TPS drops, admins usually guess: mobs, farms, chunk loaders, redstone, plugins. LagSource replaces guessing with immediate, human-readable data.

This is **not a profiler**. It is a **first-response tool**.

## Problem Statement
When a Minecraft server lags:
- Timings are verbose and hard to interpret
- Profilers like Spark require knowledge and time
- Admins panic, restart the server, or blindly kill entities

Admins need fast answers, not forensic analysis.

## Target Audience
- SMP owners
- Skyblock admins
- Prison servers
- Small-to-mid networks
- Moderators with limited technical knowledge

## Value Proposition
LagSource answers one simple question:

> “What is causing lag right now?”

It provides:
- Immediate visibility
- Zero configuration required
- Safe, read-only diagnostics
- Actionable output in seconds

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- No performance profiling
- No historical data
- No automated fixes
- No long-running sampling
- No plugin blame assignment

LagSource points — it does not solve.

## Pricing Position
- $5.00 – $9.99
- Positioned as a utility diagnostic
- Complementary to Spark, not a replacement

## Competitive Landscape
### Existing Tools
- Spark – powerful, but intimidating and verbose
- Timings – raw data, poor UX, hard to act on
- ClearLag-style plugins – destructive and unsafe

### Differentiation
LagSource is:
- Instant
- Human-readable
- Zero-learning-curve
- Fully read-only

## Success Metrics
- Admins identify lag sources in under 10 seconds
- Minimal performance impact
- No false expectations about “fixing” lag
